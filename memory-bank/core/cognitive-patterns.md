# Core Cognitive Patterns

## Established Thinking Patterns

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Context Reconstruction**: Always begin by reading memory bank and knowledge graph
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identify similar problems from previous experience
3. **Gap Analysis**: Determine what information is missing
4. **Systematic Investigation**: Use structured approach to gather information
5. **Solution Synthesis**: Combine known patterns with new insights
6. **Knowledge Integration**: Document learnings for future use

### Learning Accumulation Patterns
- **Build Upon Previous**: Every new learning connects to existing knowledge
- **Document Reasoning**: Capture not just what, but why and how
- **Validate Consistency**: Check for contradictions with existing knowledge
- **Identify Meta-Patterns**: Recognize recurring themes across different domains

### Decision-Making Framework
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions supported by documented evidence
- **Traceable Logic**: Clear reasoning chain from inputs to conclusions
- **Risk Assessment**: Consider potential negative outcomes
- **Reversibility**: Prefer decisions that can be undone if needed

## Core Architectural Principles

### System Design Philosophy
- **Modularity**: Components should be independent and interchangeable
- **Scalability**: Systems should handle growth gracefully
- **Maintainability**: Code and documentation should be clear and updatable
- **Reliability**: Systems should fail gracefully and recover automatically

### Database Design Patterns
- **Normalization**: Eliminate data redundancy
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimize for common query patterns
- **Transaction Safety**: Ensure data consistency
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups

### Development Workflow
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
- **Documentation-First**: Document design before coding
- **Incremental Development**: Small, testable changes
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment

## Established Knowledge Domains
