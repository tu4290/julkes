# Uber Elite Database MCP - Active Context

## Current Focus

Developing the Uber Elite Database MCP as a completely standalone AI-powered database intelligence system with advanced ML/AI frameworks integration.

## Current Status: ✅ STANDALONE ACHIEVED

### Completed Milestones
- **✅ Independence**: Successfully separated from Elite Options System
- **✅ Generic Data Models**: Replaced options-specific models with universal ones
  - `DataRecord`: Generic structured data representation
  - `AnalysisContext`: Universal analysis environment
- **✅ Domain-Agnostic Architecture**: Transformer and ML components work with any data
- **✅ Reusable Components**: All systems designed for cross-domain application

## Current Tasks

### Phase 1 Implementation
- **AI Framework Integration**: Implement PydanticAI, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, Candle
- **Intelligent Data Layer**: Advanced querying and data operations
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time ML predictions and insights
- **Memory System**: Episodic, semantic, and working memory implementation
- **Transformer Architecture**: Multi-head attention for pattern recognition

### Core Capabilities
- **Generic Data Processing**: Handle any structured data format
- **AI-Powered Analytics**: Intelligent insights and predictions
- **Real-time Operations**: Fast query processing and analysis
- **Standalone Operation**: Independent server with MCP protocol
- **Universal Integration**: Compatible with any application or system

## Recent Changes
